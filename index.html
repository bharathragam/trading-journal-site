<h3>Market Basics</h3>
<p>
Markets move because of demand and supply.  
Price changes when buyers or sellers become stronger.
</p>

<h3>Risk Management</h3>
<p>
Risk management means protecting your capital first.  
Never risk money you cannot afford to lose.
</p>

<h3>Trading Psychology</h3>
<p>
Emotions like fear and greed affect trading decisions.  
Discipline is more important than predictions.
